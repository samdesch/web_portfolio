# Web Portfolio

## Description

​This web application displays the template for what will eventually include additional web projects of mine. Currently, the page begins with a title and a navigation bar at top right linking to the different sections of the page: "About Me", "Work", "Contact Me", and "Resume". Each of these sections is further down the page, and wil eventually link to completed and deployed web pages, as they become available.

This page was created in order for me to showcase the various projects that I will have completed in the next five months and beyond, as well as personal information such as contact info, current resume, and a concise, relevant biography.

Although the "Work" section currently does not link to any completed projects, in the future it will include web applications created using HTML, CSS JavaScript, Node, React, and several databases, SQL and MongoDB chief among them.
​
even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
​
needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out?
​
include a link to the deployed application here.
​

​

​
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
