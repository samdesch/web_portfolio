# Web Portfolio

## Description

​This web application displays the template for what will eventually include additional web projects of mine. Currently, the page begins with a title and a navigation bar at top right linking to the different sections of the page: "About Me", "Work", "Contact Me", and "Resume". Each of these sections is further down the page, and wil eventually link to completed and deployed web pages, as they become available.

This page was created in order for me to showcase the various projects that I will have completed in the next five months and beyond, as well as personal information such as contact info, current resume, and a concise, relevant biography.

Although the "Work" section currently does not link to any completed projects, in the future it will include web applications created using HTML, CSS JavaScript, Node, React, and several databases, SQL and MongoDB chief among them.
